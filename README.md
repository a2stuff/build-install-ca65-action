# Build & Install ca65 Action

This action will build and install the cc65 assembler components (ca65, ld65).

* The tip-of-tree version from https://github.com/cc65/cc65 is used.
* Targets are built and installed, so later steps can use the `ca65` and `ld65` commands directly.

The action has no inputs or outputs.
